I am currently a first year PhD Mathematics student at [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/). I study [Functional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis) (more specifically, [Operator Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_theory) and its interactions with [Complex Function Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis)) under the supervision under [Dr. Md. Ramiz Reza](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/ramiz/). 

When I am not doing Maths, you can find me dabbling with free and open source softwares and my guitar. [BTW I use Debian](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch).

Welcome to my first blog entry, marking the beginning of a new chapter as I start my PhD journey. After successfully completing my master's degree in mathematics at IISER Thiruvananthapuram with respectable grades, I have made the decision to continue my academic pursuits with a PhD at the same institution.

This decision was not without its challenges. I was presented with a compelling opportunity to pursue a PhD at the esteemed [Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/). The interview process at IISc Bangalore was rigorous, and I initially doubted my chances of success. Nevertheless, I did manage to secure a spot, placing me in a dilemma. You might wonder why anyone would forego a PhD position at IISc Bangalore, one of India's most prestigious institutions, in favor of a lower-ranked university. Allow me to address your questions.

Before I secured a spot at IISc Bangalore, my master's thesis advisor [Dr. Md. Ramiz Reza](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/faculty/ramiz/) offered me a PhD position at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, which I accepted without hesitation. He has proven to be a dedicated and supportive mentor, and I genuinely enjoy working under his supervision. His strong work ethic and willingness to invest time in his students have made this choice all the more appealing. My keen interest in Analysis, in particular, Functional Analysis and Operator Theory, had grown exponentially under his tutelage.

During my master's thesis, I studied [Kenneth Hoffman](https://math.mit.edu/about/history/obituaries/hoffman.php)'s monograph/book, "[Banach Spaces of Analytic Functions](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Banach_Spaces_of_Analytic_Functions.html?id=YUP_AwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)." (NB: Kenneth Hoffman is well known for his textbook on Linear Algebra.) Recognizing that I wasn't entirely prepared to tackle this notorious textbook, known for skipping details wildly, I supplemented my study with various other resources. My advisor proved to be an invaluable resource, always approachable and ready to assist whenever I stumbled upon a complex proof or struggled to grasp a particular concept. Despite the textbook's nature, I was determined to tackle it.

The interplay between Operator Theory and Complex Analysis intrigued me deeply. In 1948, [Arne Beurling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Beurling) established a compelling connection between shift-invariant subspaces, a key concept in Operator Theory, and inner functions, a fundamental notion in Complex Function Theory. (I plan to explore this fascinating topic in a forthcoming blog post.) Since my research interests aligned with those of my master's thesis advisor, and the odds of working in Operator Theory appeared somewhat slim, I concluded that switching institutions might not be the most sensible move.

Whether I made the right decision remains uncertain, only time will give a definitive answer. In the meanwhile, I intend to share captivating insights into Functional Analysis, Operator Theory and Complex Function Theory through my blog posts. So, stay tuned!
